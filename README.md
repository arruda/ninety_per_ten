# Install
You need to have pipenv installed. To install run (outside of any virtual environment)
```
pip install pipenv
```

Prepare venv (only Python 2 is supported):
```shell
$ pipenv --two
```

Cython has to be installed before any other requirement, or else installation will break.

```

Then, install everything:
```shell
$ pipenv install
```
